# ROC Curve Analysis Project

This project is done for a Bachelor's thesis within the CSE3000 Research Project course edition 2024 Q4 at TU Delft. 
The project provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and interpreting ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves, which are commonly used in machine learning for binary classification problems. 
The project is implemented in Python and uses Jupyter notebooks for interactive visualization and explanation.

## Project Overview

The project covers the following topics:

1. Definition and purpose of ROC curves in evaluating classification algorithms.
2. Interpretation of ROC curves and understanding how changes in threshold values affect sensitivity and specificity.
3. Explanation of key terms related to ROC curves such as True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), Sensitivity, Specificity, and Area Under the Curve (AUC).
4. Interactive visualizations to understand the impact of changing thresholds on the ROC curve and classification outcomes.
5. Exercises to reinforce understanding and application of concepts.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- Jupyter
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Bokeh

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries used in requirements.txt file.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run Jupyter Notebook to open the `ROC_curve (1).ipynb` file.
5. Follow along with the notebook, running each cell to see the outputs and visualizations.
